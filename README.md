This is a simple codec implemented with strategy pattern.

Currently only two algorithms are supported:
1. Caesar shift
2. Huffmann

Future work:
* Write a header to file for huffman encoding
* Move read/write logic. (Possibly to each encoding strategy?)
* Better memory management with more unique pointers
* More algorithms
